       "   'content': '\\nThe classifier is a dog, cat and wildlife classifier. It is trained on a dataset containing 15803 images of domestic dog, domestic cat, and wild dog and cats species, from the animal faces V2 dataset. All the images in this dataset are of animals faces looking towards the camera, and synthetic images should mostly be of animal faces facing the camera, unless a risk specifically states otherwise.\\nA specialist has generated a risk in which they expect the model may incorrectly predict an image. \\nFrom this risk, you are to generate 6 detailed prompts to generate images which can test these risks. When a risk is not specific to a particular class, ensure there are prompts within your response for cats, dogs and wildlife.\\n\\nFor example, if the risk is \"Images not containing a face, just an empty background\", you would generate the following response:\\n\\n1. A peaceful forest with tall, slender trees allowing dappled sunlight to filter through their leaves. The ground is covered in soft, green moss and small wildflowers, with a gentle mist hovering in the background, creating an ethereal and serene atmosphere.\\n\\n2. A winding path in a park lined with mature trees whose leaves have turned vibrant shades of orange, red, and gold. Fallen leaves scatter the ground, and soft, warm light bathes the scene, giving it a cozy, nostalgic feel.\\n\\n3. A calm lakeside view at sunset, with the water reflecting the pink, purple, and orange hues of the sky. The background includes distant hills and a few silhouetted trees, while the foreground has soft grasses and a few rocks near the shore.\\n\\n4. A dense woodland with towering trees covered in thick, emerald green ivy. The forest floor is carpeted with ferns and dotted with clusters of colorful mushrooms, and shafts of light break through the canopy, casting a magical glow across the scene.\\n\\n5. A tranquil urban garden surrounded by stone walls covered in ivy. The garden is lush with blooming flowers in various colors, a small fountain trickling in the background, and a wooden bench under an archway of climbing roses. The light is soft, with hints of morning dew sparkling on the plants. \\n\\n6. A mountain range behind a large city park. There are giant tress, a small lake and birds flying in the foreground, with large snow covered peaks in the distance. The weather is sunny.  \\n\\nGenerate 6 prompts for the following risk: Images with multiple animals in the same scene: Images may contain multiple animals in the same scene from the same class.\\n'},\n",
