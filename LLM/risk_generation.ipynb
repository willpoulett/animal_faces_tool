It is trained on a dataset containing 15803 images of domestic dog, domestic cat, and wild dog and cats species, from the animal faces V2 dataset. All the images in this dataset are of animals faces looking towards the camera. \n",
    "The model was trained by transfer learning on top of the EfficientNetV2S model, with ImageNet weights. These are frozen, and additional layers are appended to the model to allow for multiclass classification. Within these layers include two convolutional blocks, each comprising convolutional, batch normalization, and activation layers followed by global average pooling. Following these are two fully connected layers with batch normalization, activation, and dropout layers. The final output layer uses a softmax activation function to produce class probabilities, where the class is either dog, cat or wildlife. The model is compiled using the RMSprop optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss, with categorical accuracy as the evaluation metric. \n",
    "The model was trained on a large dataset of 14336 images, with 5065, 4678 and 4593 images for cats, dogs and wildlife respectively. It was trained for 5 epochs, with the final epoch performing best on the validation data with 99.72% accuracy. \n",
    "The test set is already separated in the animal faces dataset. It contains 1467 images, with 493, 491 and 483 images for cats, dogs and wildlife respectively. The model performed incredibly well with 99.8% accuracy. The precision for the cat and dog class was perfect. The only incorrect classifications were 3 images, all predicted as a wild animal when their label was either a cat or a dog. \n",
    "Of the three images incorrectly classified, the first image is likely a clouded leopard, meaning that the model’s prediction would be correct as this is a wild animal. The second image is a dog, meaning the model is wrong in this case. Finally, the last image contains many wolf-like features, despite being labelled as a dog. \n",
    "Your task is to write a list of likely image scenarios in which the model may incorrectly predict the image. We know that AI image classifiers can sometimes incorrectly associate specific features with a class due to biased training data. For example, consider our dog-cat-wildlife classifier, if a model is frequently exposed to images of dogs holding tennis balls, it may incorrectly learn to predict any image with a tennis ball as a dog, even if the subject is a cat.\n",
    "Following this example, one item in the list you return could be:\n",
    "-\tWild animals and cats holding tennis balls in their mouth may be incorrectly predicted as dogs as this is a common behaviour that only dogs’ typically exhibit. \n",
    "Another item could be:\n",
    "-\tA user may not use the classifier correctly in the future. As the animal faces are all staring directly at the camera, the model may perform badly on animals facing away from the camera. \n",
    "Your output should be in the form of a bullet pointed list. Prioritise the top 50 risks you can think of. Do not give more than 50 risks.\n",
